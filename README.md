# Password-Generator-W-Chrome-Extension JSON
This project includes the JSON file and formatting for the chrome extension

In this project, I wanted to challenge myself on creating a password generating Web App after getting the idea from Scrimba without having to look up tutorials as that is the best way to make sure that I am learning. 

In addition, this Web App is also ready to be deployed as a Google Chrome extension with suitable formatting and the JSON file.
