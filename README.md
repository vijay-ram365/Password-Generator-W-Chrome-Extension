# Password-Generator-W-Chrome-Extension
This project includes JSON and formatting for the chrome extension

In this project, I wanted to challenge myself on creating a password generating Web App after getting the idea from Scrimba without having to look up tutorials as that is the best way to make sure that I am learning. 

In addition, this Web App is also ready to be deployed as a Google Chrome extension with formatting and JSON resources in place.
